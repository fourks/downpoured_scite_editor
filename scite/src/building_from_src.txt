To build from source, perform the following:
(adapted from /downpoured_scite_editor/scite/src/scite/README.prev)

*** Windows version ***

A C++ compiler is required. Visual Studio .NET 2008 is the development system
used for most development. Microsoft's free Visual Studio Express can also be used.

1) unzip the binaries from /downpoured_scite_editor/scite/scite.exe.win32.zip
	into /downpoured_scite_editor/scite/
2) create a directory /downpoured_scite_editor/scite/scite225_mainline
3) unzip /downpoured_scite_editor/scite/src/scintilla/scintilla_225.zip
	into /downpoured_scite_editor/scite/scite225_mainline/scintilla
	there should now be directories
	/downpoured_scite_editor/scite/scite225_mainline/scintilla/win32/ and so on.
4) unzip /downpoured_scite_editor/scite/src/scite/python/libs.zip 
	into the directory /downpoured_scite_editor/scite/src/scite/python/libs
5) open a 'developer command prompt' 
	(from the Start menu, under 
	all programs/microsoft visual studio x/visual studio tools/ )
6) in this command prompt, 
	cd c:/path/to/downpoured_scite_editor/scite/scite225_mainline/scintilla
	cd win32
	nmake -f scintilla.mak
	(wait for build)
	cd c:/path/to/downpoured_scite_editor/scite/src/scite/win32
	nmake -f scite.mak
	del ..\..\..\Scite.exe
	copy ..\bin\Scite.exe ..\..\..
7) you can now run /downpoured_scite_editor/scite/Scite.exe
	

*** GTK+/Linux version ***

You must first have GTK+ 2.0 or later and GCC (4.1 or better) installed.
GTK+ 1.x will not work.
Other C++ compilers may work but may require tweaking the make file.

To build Scintilla, use the makefile located in the scintilla/gtk directory
	cd scintilla/gtk
	make
	cd ../..

To build and install SciTE, use the makefile located in the scite/gtk directory
	cd scite/gtk
	make
	make install

This installs SciTE into $prefix/bin. The value of $prefix is determined from
the location of Gnome if it is installed. This is usually /usr if installed
with Linux or /usr/local if built from source. If Gnome is not installed
/usr/bin is used as the prefix. The prefix can be overridden on the command
line like "make prefix=/opt" but the same value should be used for both make
and make install as this location is compiled into the executable. The global
properties file is installed at $prefix/share/scite/SciTEGlobal.properties.
The language specific properties files are also installed into this directory.

To remove SciTE
	make uninstall

To clean the object files which may be needed to change $prefix
	make clean

The current make file only supports static linking between SciTE and Scintilla.
