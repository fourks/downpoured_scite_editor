# SciTE Python Extension
# Ben Fisher, 2011

See downpoured_scite_editor/scite/readme.txt for an overview.
Here are specific implementation details.

Why embed Python 2.5 and not 2.6?
	Installation and Windows XP compatibility is much simpler with Python 2.5. All that's needed is msvcr71.dll.
	In my experience if 2.6 features are needed, they can be executed 

How much of the Python standard library is included?
	python25.zip contains much of the Python 2.5 standard library.
	Python automatically loads modules from a file named 'python25.zip'.
	I included most of the library including sockets and ctypes, you should be able to
	add anything missing to python25.zip.
	
Performance:
	Calling from Python into Scite is very quick. Binary searches are used to find the right IDM constant.
	Python is heavier than Lua but the difference in boot time should not be noticeable on any recent machine.
	The pythonsetup.py wrapper provides a more convenient interface, so that one doesn't need to account for 
	the differences in how SciTE getters, setters, and functions pass and return data. 

Known issues:
	gcc makefile not updated.
	gtk directory not updated.
	ScApp.Fullscreen()
	ScEditor.GetStyleAt()
	ScEditor.AssignCmdKey()
	
	The following are not officially tested+supported
	void	ScEditor.SetWordChars(, string characters)
	void	ScEditor.SetAutoCFillUps(, string characterSet)
	void	ScEditor.SetMarginLeft(, int pixelWidth)
	void	ScEditor.SetMarginRight(, int pixelWidth)
	int	ScEditor.PointXFromPosition(, position pos)
	int	ScEditor.PointYFromPosition(, position pos)
	void	ScEditor.SetWhitespaceChars(, string characters)

	Certain methods can read past end of file. This is a limitation of Scintilla.

	If the app exists while a MessageBox is open, an error will be shown.
