Overview
-------------------
You can now write plugins and scripts in Python to customize SciTE. 
You have access to the powerful standard library of Python.

Usage
-------------------
If you open the global options file, you will see a command for 'Python run script'.
When you run this command (from the Tools menu or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+k),
a sample Python script will run.

Modify this sample script by editing 'callFromCmd' in scite_extend.py.
You can call one of the many functions documented in scite_extend_doc.txt.
scite_extend.py also shows the callbacks that will be run. You can also put code here.
